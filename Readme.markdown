# Today I

We had the urge to broadcast our activities (things we did today) from our local Hackerspace to the world.

This is a very quick and dirty hack, using our LDAP Server for authentication and our Wordpress Blog as target Platform, but it works and this is what matters!

## Dependencies

__Today I__ runs in python 2.7 and has some dependencies (see `_etc/reqirements.pip` for details). To install them run the following:

* pip install flask
* pip install flask-login
* pip install flask-wtf
* pip install simpleldap
* pip install img-rotate

Don't forget to edit the `config.py` afterwards. :smiley_cat:
