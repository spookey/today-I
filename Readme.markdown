# Today I

We had the urge to broadcast our activities (things we did today) from our local Hackerspace to the world.

This is a very quick and dirty hack, using our LDAP Server for authentication and our Wordpress Blog as target Platform, but it works and this is what matters!

## Dependencies

Today I runs in python 2.7 and has following dependencies:

pip install flask
pip install flask-login
pip install flask-wtf
pip install simpleldap
